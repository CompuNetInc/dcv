DigiCert & Neustar/UltraDNS Domain Validation
========
Command line tool to check DigiCert for expiring 'soon' domains. If deemed expiring (default 90 days, user configurable),
it will automatically validate the domains via dns cname records (assuming you own the zone in UltraDNS).

Due to DigiCert API rate limiting, any number of domains above 40 will be instead run as 
separate batch jobs, 40 domains each, until completion.

Two installation options:
- [Python based](#Python-Based)
- [Docker based](#Docker-Based)

## <a name="Python-Based"></a>Installation

Without Docker, you'll need Python 3.7+, you can install python via https://www.python.org/

Once Python is installed, using DCV is easy:

0. Highly HIGHLY recommended but not required, a virtual environment
   - `python -m venv venv`
     - `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac)
     - `venv/bin/activate` (Windows)
1. Installing from GitHub     
   - (if on Windows and you don't have git installed, install git first)
      https://git-scm.com/download/windows
   - `pip install git+https://github.com/compunetinc/dcv.git`

..and you're done!

## Usage

The installation process will install an executable `dcv` on your path. You can confirm this like:

```shell
Usage: dcv [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  DCV: DigiCert/Neustar (UltraDNS) Domain Control Validator.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  check     Check domains for expiring 'soon' validations.
  runall    Find all expiring domains and validate them.
  validate  Validate single domain manually, regardless of expiration date.
```

You can also get help for each individual command (check/validate/runall) via `dcv COMMAND --help`

If you get a complaint about "command not found" you maybe installed dcv into a different virtual environment 
or forgot to activate the virtual environment.

- 'check' will find all domains expiring soon (default 90 days out, can be modified with --num-days xyz). 
- 'validate' is for validating a specific domain regardless of expiration status.
- 'runall' will do just what it sounds like, grab all domains expiring 'soon' AND validate them as well, in one step.
    You can send a list of domains (from a file) with the --file/-f flag if you don't want to search 'all' domains.

#### Requirements
A DigiCert API key is required in order to authenticate to DigiCert, and Neustar Username/Password is required for that API. 
These credentials will be prompted for if not given via the appropriate flags, 
however you can also use environment variables to avoid getting prompted on each run if you are doing multiple passes 
or if running dcv in an automated fashion.

The environment variables are listed below:

  * DIGICERT_KEY
  * NEU_USERNAME
  * NEU_PASSWORD

Set these variables appropriately for your operating system (see below), and you won't be prompted anymore!

Linux/Mac:
```shell
export DIGICERT_KEY=abcd123456
export NEU_USERNAME=myuser
export NEU_PASSWORD=mypassword
```
Windows:
```shell
set DIGICERT_KEY=abcd123456
set NEU_USERNAME=myuser
set NEU_PASSWORD=mypassword
```


### Example Usage
**All commands support adding --help to get extra information**
If using docker, precede all commands with `docker-compose run`, i.e. `docker-compose run dcv check -d abc.com`

Logfile with error messages and final domain statuses found in dcv.log

If manually specifying secrets (recommended to use Environment Variables, see above):
  - `dcv check --key ABCD1234`
  - `dcv validate --key ABCD1234 --username NEU-USERNAME --password NEU-PASSWORD`
  - `dcv runall --key ABCD1234 --username NEU-USERNAME --password NEU-PASSWORD`

#### Check status only:
- Check all domains, 90 days (default) expiration:
  - `dcv check`
- Check all domains, 300 days (custom) expiration:
  - `dcv check --num-days 300`
- Check only one domain, get validation status & expiration:
  - `dcv check --domain abc.com`

#### Validate a single domain:
- Validate a specific domain regardless of expiration status:
  - `dcv validate` (will be prompted for domain name)
  - `dcv validate --domain abc.com`
- Validate a specific domain, lower timeout seconds (recommended >90):
  - `dcv validate --domain abc.com --timeout 120`

#### Runall:
- Check for and validate ALL expiring domains, 90 days (default) expiration:
  - `dcv runall`
- Check for and validate ALL expiring domains, 300 days (custom) expiration:
  - `dcv runall --num-days 300`
- Check for and validate all domains found in \<domainsfile.txt\>, 90 days (default) expiration:
  - `dcv runall --file domainsfile.txt`
- Check for and validate all domains found in \<domainsfile.txt\>, 300 days (custom) expiration:
  - `dcv runall --file domainsfile.txt`


## <a name="Docker-Based"></a> Usage with Docker

You can use this with Docker Desktop (or whatever container runtime, really) and docker-compose so you don't have to 
mess with installing anything (other than Docker Desktop/compose of course). 
Information can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/.
The advantage to using Docker is that you'll no longer have any Python or Operating System dependencies to worry about!

The simplest way to get started is to run `docker-compose up` while in this directory.
If you have never built the image, it will be built for you, you'll get something like this (first run only):

```

Once the container has been built, you can run the commands as normal, 
just prepend 'docker-compose run` to any command, ie:
- `docker-compose run dcv check --num-days 120`
- `docker-compose run dcv runall`

..etc!
